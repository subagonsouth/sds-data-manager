    We need to ensure that the returned list of metakernel files includes
    all requested kernels, especially for ephemeris kernels. The API can
    return the "best" ephemeris kernels, which can include both historical
    and predicted kernels depending on the input time range. If the user
    specifically requests only historical ephemeris kernels, we must verify
    that only historical files are returned. Otherwise, both historical
    and predicted kernels are acceptable.

    Additionally, the API can return multiple kernels for the same source
    if the files cover specific date ranges. Because of this, we must
    check that all requested sources are present in the returned
    metakernel files, rather than performing a direct one-to-one
    comparison. Each source may correspond to multiple kernel files.

    Newly ingested attitude_history or pointing_attitude kernels are handled

    1. Same coverage as an existing kernel, but a higher version number (a
       correction to already-delivered data) -> the entire coverage range is
       reprocessed, since previously processed data can no longer be assumed
       to be valid.
    2. Coverage that extends an existing kernel with the same start date
       (the normal append-only growth pattern, since new segments are only
       ever appended) -> only the segments of coverage that are new are
       reprocessed. Per-segment coverage was already computed with SPICE
       tools (spiceypy ckcov) at ingestion time and is stored on each file's
       `file_intervals_datetime`.
    3. A new start date, meaning no earlier kernel shares it (the kernel has
       "rolled over" to a new coverage window) -> the entire coverage range
       is reprocessed, since none of it has been processed before.
